# TIC-TAC-TOE
hackreactor tic tac toe project


We were given 1 day to complete a tic tac toe game using only pure javascript.
the requirements included:
A reset button
It had to know when someone won
and it had to keep track of wins
The optional pieces were:
styling
entering names

Also I made my board in js, I don't really know why but that's just the way that I did it lol.
